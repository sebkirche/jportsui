**JPortsUI is a completed GUI for MacPorts.**  The workflow is similar to Debian's Synaptic for Aptitude.

Presently, end users can launch JPortsUI on Mac OS X 10.6 thru 10.9 by simply double-clicking the .JAR file or by running a bash script that builds from the openly available source code.  This requires Java SDK 6 or newer which is typically installed by default.

Port info includes dependency and dependents tracking, installed files display, and variant picking.  It also attempts to retrieve a Port's web domain "favicon" logo graphic.  Also included are data exploration tools that can enlighten one as to the current state of FOSS on the Mac.

If uninstalling, there are no preference files or caches to remove.
